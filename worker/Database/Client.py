    """Async session factory keyed by PHYSICAL database.

    After the AIXII consolidation there are TWO physical databases: `aixii` (every aviation
    domain as a schema) and `service`. The public API is unchanged — callers still pass the
    logical name (`main`/`cirium`/`airlabs`/`flightradar`/`aviationedge`/`service`); DBSettings
    maps it to a physical DB (``physical_db``) and the engine/session cache is keyed by that
    PHYSICAL name, so the five aviation logical names SHARE one pooled engine. Which table a
    query hits is decided by the model's schema (see Database/config.py), not by the session.
